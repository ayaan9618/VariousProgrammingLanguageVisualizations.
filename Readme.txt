Project Overview

This project explores global usage patterns of various programming languages. The data is normalized to a base of 10,000 people per country. The project involves data visualization using both Tableau and R programming language to compare the popularity of different programming languages in various countries.

Files Included
- data.csv: The dataset with programming language usage across multiple countries.
- R_visualization.R: R script to generate histograms for programming language usage.
- Tableau Workbook (.twb or .twbx): Tableau visualization file.

Project Breakdown:

1. Data Source:
   - The dataset contains information about how different programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++) are used across various countries.
   - Each column represents a specific programming language, and each row corresponds to a country.

2. Data Visualization in Tableau:
  - Objective: Create global map views and bar charts to analyze language usage.
   - Steps:
     - Use data.csv to load into Tableau.
     - Map language usage per country using geographic roles.
     - Create bar charts for each language.
   - Outcome: Tableau visualizes the data globally with interactive features to compare usage by language and country.

3. Data Visualization in R:
   - Objective: Generate histograms for each programming language using base R functions.
   - Steps:
     - Use the provided R_visualization.R script to load the data and generate histograms for Python, Java, C++, and other languages.
   - *Outcome*: R provides individual histograms for each language, helping to visualize the distribution of programming language usage across countries.

Conclusion:

   - This project demonstrates how data visualization in both Tableau and R can provide powerful insights into the global trends in programming languages.
   - Tableau offers interactive, global mapping, while R provides a lightweight, script-based approach for creating basic visualizations.
