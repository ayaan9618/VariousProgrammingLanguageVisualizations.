*Data Visualization in Tableau Software*

#### Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing programming language usage across various countries using Tableau. The data showcases the popularity of different programming languages in countries normalized to a base of 10,000 people.

#### Files Included
- data.csv: Contains the dataset with programming language usage per country.
- Tableau Workbook File (.twb or .twbx): Includes all visualization and mapping.

#### Steps for Visualization in Tableau:
1. *Open Tableau*: Launch Tableau on your machine.
2. *Load Data*: 
   - Go to "Connect to a File" and select your data.csv file.
3. *Data Cleaning*: Ensure that the columns are properly formatted as:
   - Countries as "Dimensions."
   - Programming language usage as "Measures."
4. *Create Visualizations*:
   - *Map Visualization*: 
     - Use the Country field as "Geographic Role."
     - Drag and drop programming language usage fields (Python, Java, etc.) onto the map.
     - Customize colors and legends to represent usage per country.
   - *Bar Charts/Histograms*: 
    - For each programming language, create a bar chart to compare usage across countries.
5. *Adjust Design*: Use Tableau's formatting options to adjust the look and feel of your visualizations (colors, labels, fonts, etc.).
6. *Save & Export*: Save the Tableau workbook and export visualizations as images or dashboards as needed.

#### Key Tableau Features Used:
- Map visualization for global analysis.
- Bar charts to compare programming languages.
- Custom colors and labels for better clarity.

#### Conclusion
Tableauâ€™s visualizations provide a clear global view of programming language distribution and make it easy to interpret the data.
